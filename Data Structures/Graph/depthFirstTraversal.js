// the whole idea is to travel down a tree to the bottom before going out
// use a stack
// Rule 1 − Visit the adjacent unvisited vertex. Mark it as visited. Display it. Push it in a stack.
// Rule 2 − If no adjacent vertex is found, pop up a vertex from the stack. (It will pop up all the vertices from the stack, which do not have adjacent vertices.)
// Rule 3 − Repeat Rule 1 and Rule 2 until the stack is empty.
